This file is for checking your custom block LVS using sky130A PDK
-------------------------------------------------------------

Pay attention:
1. Just check the one signal cdl file

2. the name of block in gds & cdl/sp file must be same

3. the cdl file must use 'x' as prefix for the mos/capacitor as declaration identifies

4. there are two mode to check your lvs: top-level mode / subckt mode for doing LVS check -> reference run_lvspex.sh file content

5. for multi-finger gds -> sometimes need to use m=2...(or other number) to identify your multi-finger MOS transistor in cdl

6. all cdl/sp file need to write using capital letters.
-------------------------------------------------------------

How to use it to do LVS check for your custom block?
Go to the makefile, change to your gds file path, cdl/sp file path, blockname, PDK path

---------run the lvs check----------------------------------

use command: make

the lvs report in RESULT_LVS directory.
---------clean the run---------------------------------------

use command: make clean

-------------------------------------------------------------
What the file means?

ORIGINAL_CDL: your original file copy from your cdl path

EXTRACT_CDL: the cdl file extract from your gds for lvs check

EXTRACT_PEX: the pex file extract from your gds

EXTRACT_SIM: the sim file extract from your gds

FLATTEN_GDS: the gds file at the flatten state

RESULT_LVS: the lvs report file for your LVS check
