Developer's Guide
===============================

* First setup the environment by installing all dependencies using the ``dependencies.sh`` script present in the home of OpenFASOC github repository. To test whether the installation happened correctly or not, try running the temp-sense-gen;

* Once the setup is ready, read the "Things to improve" under this section (right below) and start working on them;

* You can also start working on improving the code base, docs, CI flow, improving the generators or creating your own generator.

.. note::

    If you'd like to suggest new features, enhancements or bug fixes, feel free to `submit an issue <https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC/issues>`_ in the GitHub repo.
