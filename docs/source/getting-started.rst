Getting Started with OpenFASoC
===============================

Install Dependencies
###########################

Go to the home location of this repository (where this README.rst file is located) and run `source ./Dependencies.sh`. This will install all the python libraries required for OpenFASoC, tools (openroad, Yosys, magic, netgen, Klayout, Ngspice) via conda packages and skywater-pdk on your machine. This will also set the environment variable PDK_ROOT to the pdk data location. The script supports Ubuntu and CentOS. For RHEL 7 and 8, the script will install all dependencies except Klayout.


Run OpenFASoC flow
##############################

Generic way
.................

* First clone the OpenFASoC github repository using the command - `git clone https://github.com/idea-fasoc/openfasoc`

* Now edit the platform_config.json file as suggested in the `Spice Simulation Flow` subsection under OpenFASoC section

* Edit the open_pdks location according to the PDK_ROOT variable

* Set the PDK_ROOT variable to your skywater-pdk location till the sky130A level (not required if the dependencies are installed via the dependencies.sh script)

* Now go to one of the generators and run `make` to list down all the generator specific targets.

* Run `make <library>_<generator>_<mode>` to begin the flow

Below is an example for the temp-sense generator


.. code-block:: bash

    $cd openfasoc/generators/temp-sense-gen
    $make

    OpenFASOC is focused on open-source automate analog generation
    from user specification to GDSII with fully open-sourced tools.
    This project is led by a team of researchers at the Universities of Michigan is inspired from FASOC whcih sits on proprietary tools

    IP: Temperature Sensor
    Supported Technology: Sky130A
    Supported Library: sky130hd

    Targets supported:
    1. make sky130hd_temp
        >> This will create the macro for the thermal sensor, creates the lef/def/gds files and performs lvs/drc checks. It won't run simulations.
    2. make sky130hd_temp_verilog
        >> This will create the verilog file for the thermal sensor IP. It doesn't create a macro, won't create lef/def/gds files and won't run simulations
    3. make sky130hd_temp_full
        >> This will create the macro for the thermal sensor, creates the lef/def/gds files, performs lvs/drc checks and also runs simulations.
        >> [Warning] Currently, this target is in alpha phase
    4. make clean
        >> This will clean all files generated during the run inside the run/, flow/ and work/ directories
    5. make help
        >> Displays this message
    $make sky130hd_temp


Run OpenFASoC via docker
.........................

**Another way to run the generators is using the openfasoc docker image which is currently used to test the temp-sense generator flow during smoke test**

Install docker on your machine before you proceed

1. Clone the OpenFASOC repository - `git clone https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC.git`

2. Run this command to access OpenFASOC folder from the container - `docker run -v </path/to/OpenFASOC/clone>:/shared/OpenFASOC/ -w /shared/OpenFASOC/ msaligane/openfasoc:stable bash -c "pip3 install -r requirements.txt && cd openfasoc/generators/temp-sense-gen/ && make clean && make sky130hd_temp"`

3. To view results after the PnR run, go to `/<path_to_OpenFASOC>/openfasoc/generators/temp-sense/work` where you could find the final gds and def files, drc and lvs reports, the spice netlists and the verilog file.

4. To view results after the full run (including simulations), go to `/<path_to_OpenFASOC>/openfasoc/generators/temp-sense/simulations/run/` where you can find the directory for the type of inverter-header combination in which you can find the simulation log files along with the spice netlists for various temperature calibrations.

**Note** Files will be generated with root privileges. So, while cleaning the run, use `sudo` to have a complete clean.
