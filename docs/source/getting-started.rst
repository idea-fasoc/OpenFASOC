Express Installation
#####################

First, ``cd`` into a directory of your choice and clone the OpenFASoC repository:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/idea-fasoc/openfasoc

Now go to the home location of this repository (where the README.rst file is located) and run `sudo ./dependencies.sh`. This will install the latest version of all Python libraries, tools (OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, KLayout and Ngspice) **via Conda packages** and skywater-pdk as required by OpenFASoC. It will also set the ``PDK_ROOT`` environment variable to the pdk data location.

.. warning::

  The ``dependencies.sh`` script supports Ubuntu and CentOS. In RHEL 7 and 8, the script will install all dependencies except KLayout, which has to be installed manually.

.. note::

  gdsfactory, a Python package used by some of the generators, requires Python version ``>=3.7``. If your machine does not have a supported version, the installation of gdsfactory is skipped.

Done!

Manual Installation
#####################

Standalone
^^^^^^^^^^^

First install all the dependencies required by OpenFASoC:

.. include:: ../../README.rst
  :start-after: Please install the following tools with the recommended commit ids for a stable functioning of the flow:
  :end-before: Design Generation

.. note::

  We recommend installing OpenROAD with the GUI enabled for easier debugging.

Check if the installed tools are in your PATH by running their respective commands in a terminal: ``magic``, ``netgen``, ``klayout``, ``yosys`` and ``openroad``.

Now ``cd`` into a directory of your choice and clone the OpenFASoC repository:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/idea-fasoc/openfasoc

Go to the root directory of the repo and install all required Python libraries using:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -r requirements.txt

.. note::

  If you plan to contribute, you should also run ``pip install -r requirements_dev.txt``.

Using Conda
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Conda is an open source package, dependency and environment management system available in many platforms.

OpenFASoC's dependencies can be very easily installed if you're using a Conda environment. If you're not, start by `installing Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html>`_.

The `conda-eda <https://github.com/hdl/conda-eda>`_ project keeps periodic builds of most tools required by OpenFASoC in the `LiteX-Hub channel <https://anaconda.org/LiteX-Hub/>`_. To install them, start by creating a new environment for OpenFASoC (if you don't have one already):

.. code-block:: bash

  conda create --name "openfasoc" python=3.8

Then, install the available dependencies within Conda:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda install -c litex-hub magic netgen yosys openroad open_pdks.sky130a

.. note::

  KLayout isn't available yet as a Conda package at the time of writing, thus it has to be manually installed. See `their website <https://www.klayout.de/build.html>`_ for instructions.

Now ``cd`` into a directory of your choice and clone the OpenFASoC repository:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/idea-fasoc/openfasoc

Finally, ``cd`` to the root of the cloned repository and install all required Python packages in your Conda environment:

.. code-block::

  conda install --file requirements.txt


Running via Docker
#####################

Another way to run the generators is using the OpenFASoC Docker image which is currently used to test the temp-sense generator flow during CI. This alternative doesn't require to install all dependencies in your machine.

Install `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/>`_ in your machine before you proceed.

1. Clone the OpenFASOC repository:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC.git`

2. Run this command to access OpenFASOC folder from the container:

.. code-block:: bash

  `docker run -v </path/to/OpenFASOC/clone>:/shared/OpenFASOC/ -w /shared/OpenFASOC/ msaligane/openfasoc:stable bash -c "pip3 install -r requirements.txt && cd openfasoc/generators/temp-sense-gen/ && make clean && make sky130hd_temp"`

3. To view results after the flow ran (see `Run OpenFASoC flow`_), go to `/<path_to_OpenFASOC>/openfasoc/generators/temp-sense-gen/work` where you can find the final GDS and DEF files, DRC and LVS reports, the spice netlists and the Verilog file.

4. To view results after the full run (including simulations), go to `/<path_to_OpenFASOC>/openfasoc/generators/temp-sense-gen/simulations/run/` where you can find the directory for the type of inverter-header combination in which you can find the simulation log files along with the spice netlists for various temperature calibrations.

.. warning::

  In this case, files are be generated with root privileges. So, when cleaning the run, use `sudo` to have a complete clean.


Run OpenFASoC Flow
--------------------

Generic way
############

* First ``cd`` into the directory where the OpenFASoC repository was cloned;

* Now edit the `platform_config.json <https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC/blob/main/openfasoc/common/platform_config.json>`_ file, replacing the ``open_pdks`` value with the path to the sky130A/ directory;

* Export the ``PDK_ROOT`` environment variable to your skywater-pdk location until the sky130A/ directory (not required if the dependencies are installed via the dependencies.sh script);

* Now go to one of the generators with ``cd openfasoc/generators/<generator_name>`` and run ``make`` to list down all the generator specific targets;

* Run ``make <library>_<generator>_<mode>`` to begin the flow.

Below is an example of options for the temp-sense generator:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd openfasoc/generators/temp-sense-gen/
    $ make

    OpenFASOC is focused on open-source automate analog generation
    from user specification to GDSII with fully open-sourced tools.
    This project is led by a team of researchers at the University of Michigan is inspired from FASOC which sits on proprietary tools
