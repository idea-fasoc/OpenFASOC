**OpenFASoC: Fully Open-Source Autonomous SoC Synthesis using Customizable Cell-Based Synthesizable Analog Circuits**

What is OpenFASoC?
-------------------

OpenFASoC is a project focused on automated analog generation from user specification to GDSII with fully open-sourced tools. It is led by a team of researchers at the University of Michigan and is inspired from `FASoC <https://fasoc.engin.umich.edu/>`_ which sits on proprietary software.

The tool is comprised of analog and mixed-signal circuit generators, which automatically create a physical design based on user specifications.
