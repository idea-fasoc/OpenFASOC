        "This notebook serves as an introduction to the GDSFactory-based layout automation tool **GLayout** and an example two-stage Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp) generator, as a part of [OpenFASoC](https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC).  \n",
        "\n",
        "This Notebook will run as-is on Google Collab, or you can run locally by using the install steps in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRL8ksIvB-fHaqWgkgBPDUznOcDmmFhNrvzPNx9GSSkZyfhJYexEI9gBZCJ0SNNnHdUrAf1EBOeU182/pub).

        "## GDSFactory\n",
        "[GDSFactory](https://gdsfactory.github.io/gdsfactory/index.html) is a Python library for designing integrated circuit layouts in Python and save it directly in the [GDSII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDSII) format, and run DRC (Design Rule Checking) and LVS (Layout v/s Schematic) verification, or simulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## GLayout\n",
        "[GLayout](https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC/blob/main/openfasoc/generators/gdsfactory-gen/glayout/) is a layout automation python package which generates _DRC clean_ circuit layouts and SPICE netlists for any PDK (Process Design Kit). It is composed of two main parts: the _generic PDK framework_, and the _circuit generators_.\n",
        "\n",
        "The generic PDK framework allows for describing any PDK in a standardized format, defined by the `MappedPDK` class. The generators are Python functions that take as arguments a `MappedPDK` object, and a set of optional layout parameters to produce a DRC (Design Rule Checking) clean layout of a particular circuit design and the pre-PEX (Parasitic Extraction) SPICE netlist, for LVS (Layout v/s Extraction).\n",
        "\n",
        "The post-PEX netlist can be used for simulating a circuit. The simulation and performance evaluation of multiple design variations can be parallelized on a cloud platform for fast design space exploration. Fig. 1 describes the GLayout workflow.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Generators\n",
        "Generators in GLayout are Python functions that generate the layout and SPICE netlist for a circuit component. This allows for describing hierarchical and parameterized circuits, or PCells (Parameterized Cells), in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "A generator can be a utility generator such as a Via, a primitive PCell such as a MOSFET, or a complex circuit as an Op-Amp.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators are PDK-agnostic and hierarchical, and may call other generators. This allows complex components to be composed of simpler components hierarchically. Fig. 2 shows the hierarchical usage of generators in an example Op-Amp design, and Fig. 3 shows the creation of a high-level PCell from a primitive PCell.\n",
        "\n",
        "The SPICE netlist for a component is also generated hierarchically along with the layout.\n",
