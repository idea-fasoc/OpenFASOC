- Team: SaltyChip
- Design (our target): DAC for 6-bit A/D converter
- Progress: ongoing, 03/11/2024 

| Design File | Description | Remark |
| --- | --- | --- |
| inv_lib.py | Layout generation of inverter for controlling the transmission gate's PMOS and NMOS | |
| transmission_gate.py | Layout generation of a transmission gate | The layout is still under construction |
| mimcap_array.py | Layout generation of a 8x8 MIM capacitor array | Transmission gate combined with a MIM capacitor array is the aim in this project |
