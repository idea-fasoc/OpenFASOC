# Class A Amplifier
The purpose of a Class A amplifier is to provide linear amplification of an input signal. This results in low distortion of the amplified signal. 
class A amplifier can be created with two nmos transistors, called amp and load. The source of amp is connected to VSS and the drain of amp is connected the source of load. The drain of load is connected to VDD. The gate of amp is connected to the input signal and the gate of load is connected to a bias voltage. The output signal is taken from the drain of amp.

## Routing
Route together the drain of amp and the source of load.
