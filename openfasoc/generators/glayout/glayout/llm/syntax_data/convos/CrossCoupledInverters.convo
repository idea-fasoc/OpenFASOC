# Create a float parameter called nfet_width
# Create a float parameter called pfet_width
Create a float parameter called ccinvs_length
Create an int parameter called ccinvs_fingers
place 4 interdigitated transistors called ccinvs with numcols=ccinvs_fingers, length=ccinvs_length, top_row_device="pfet", bottom_row_device="nfet"
# sources are connected to pwr and gnd respectively
route between ccinvs_top_A_source_E and ccinvs_top_B_source_E using smart_route
route between ccinvs_bottom_A_source_E and ccinvs_bottom_B_source_E using smart_route
# output of each inverter goes to input of the other inverter using smart_route
route between ccinvs_top_A_drain_E and ccinvs_top_B_gate_E using smart_route
route between ccinvs_bottom_A_drain_E and ccinvs_bottom_B_gate_E using smart_route
route between ccinvs_top_B_drain_E and ccinvs_top_A_gate_E using smart_route
route between ccinvs_bottom_B_drain_E and ccinvs_bottom_A_gate_E using smart_route
# connect nfet and pfet of each inverter at the gate using smart_route
route between ccinvs_top_B_gate_E and ccinvs_bottom_B_gate_E using smart_route
route between ccinvs_top_A_gate_W and ccinvs_bottom_A_gate_W using smart_route
