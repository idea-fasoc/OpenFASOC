CrossCoupledInverters
// no imports
// create parameters: ccinvs_length, ccinvs_fingers
# Create a float parameter called nfet_width
# Create a float parameter called pfet_width
Create a float parameter called ccinvs_length
Create an int parameter called ccinvs_fingers
// place
place 4 interdigitated transistors called ccinvs with numcols=ccinvs_fingers, length=ccinvs_length, top_row_device="pfet", bottom_row_device="nfet"
// only one component placed, so no move
// cross coupled inverters, route both inverters together
# sources are connected to pwr and gnd respectively
